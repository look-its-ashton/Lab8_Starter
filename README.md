# Lab 8 - Starter
## 1.
Answer: 1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
Reason: Because then bugs can be discovered early on in development and human error is eliminated if these tests are run automatically (as an action).

## 2.
Answer: No
Reason: Because the E2E test only emulates user input which means supplying a function with certain inputs and outputs would be clunky and difficult. It would also be difficult to observe the function outputs.
